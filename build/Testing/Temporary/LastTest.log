LLMVector Implementation
==========================================================
LLMVector Comprehensive Test Suite
==================================

=== Testing Initialization ===
âœ“ PASS: Default constructor creates empty vector
âœ“ PASS: Default constructor has minimum capacity
âœ“ PASS: Default vector is empty
âœ“ PASS: Parameterized constructor creates empty vector
âœ“ PASS: Parameterized constructor respects capacity
âœ“ PASS: Float vector construction works
âœ“ PASS: String vector construction works

=== Testing Push Back and Access ===
âœ“ PASS: Size correct after push_back operations
âœ“ PASS: All elements match reference vector
âœ“ PASS: Capacity grows when needed
âœ“ PASS: Size correct after capacity growth

=== Testing Bounds Checking ===
âœ“ PASS: Accessing empty vector throws exception
âœ“ PASS: Valid access works correctly
âœ“ PASS: Accessing beyond size throws exception

=== Testing Copy Semantics ===
âœ“ PASS: Copy constructor preserves size
âœ“ PASS: Copy constructor creates correct deep copy
âœ“ PASS: Copied vector is independent
âœ“ PASS: Copy assignment preserves size
âœ“ PASS: Copy assignment creates correct deep copy
âœ“ PASS: Self-assignment preserves size
âœ“ PASS: Self-assignment preserves data

=== Testing Move Semantics ===
âœ“ PASS: Move constructor transfers size
âœ“ PASS: Moved-from vector is empty
âœ“ PASS: Move constructor transfers data correctly
âœ“ PASS: Move assignment transfers size
âœ“ PASS: Moved-from vector is empty after assignment
AFTER MOVE: 0
âœ“ PASS: Move assignment transfers data correctly

=== Testing Capacity Management ===
âœ“ PASS: Reserve doesn't shrink capacity
âœ“ PASS: Reserve increases capacity
âœ“ PASS: Reserve doesn't affect size
âœ“ PASS: No reallocation after sufficient reserve

=== Testing LLM-Specific Use Cases ===
âœ“ PASS: Token sequence has correct length
âœ“ PASS: First token is correct
âœ“ PASS: Embedding vector has correct size
âœ“ PASS: Embedding values are correct
âœ“ PASS: Batch contains correct number of sequences
âœ“ PASS: Variable length sequences work

=== Testing Memory Management ===
âœ“ PASS: Multiple allocation/deallocation cycles complete
âœ“ PASS: Zero capacity vector can still grow
âœ“ PASS: Zero capacity vector stores elements correctly
âœ“ PASS: Clear makes vector empty
âœ“ PASS: Vector reports empty after clear
âœ“ PASS: Clear preserves capacity
