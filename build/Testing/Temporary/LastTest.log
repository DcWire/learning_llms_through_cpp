LLMVector Implementation
==========================================================
LLMVector Comprehensive Test Suite
==================================

=== Testing Initialization ===
✓ PASS: Default constructor creates empty vector
✓ PASS: Default constructor has minimum capacity
✓ PASS: Default vector is empty
✓ PASS: Parameterized constructor creates empty vector
✓ PASS: Parameterized constructor respects capacity
✓ PASS: Float vector construction works
✓ PASS: String vector construction works

=== Testing Push Back and Access ===
✓ PASS: Size correct after push_back operations
✓ PASS: All elements match reference vector
✓ PASS: Capacity grows when needed
✓ PASS: Size correct after capacity growth

=== Testing Bounds Checking ===
✓ PASS: Accessing empty vector throws exception
✓ PASS: Valid access works correctly
✓ PASS: Accessing beyond size throws exception

=== Testing Copy Semantics ===
✓ PASS: Copy constructor preserves size
✓ PASS: Copy constructor creates correct deep copy
✓ PASS: Copied vector is independent
✓ PASS: Copy assignment preserves size
✓ PASS: Copy assignment creates correct deep copy
✓ PASS: Self-assignment preserves size
✓ PASS: Self-assignment preserves data

=== Testing Move Semantics ===
✓ PASS: Move constructor transfers size
✗ FAIL: Moved-from vector is empty
✓ PASS: Move constructor transfers data correctly
✓ PASS: Move assignment transfers size
✗ FAIL: Moved-from vector is empty after assignment
✓ PASS: Move assignment transfers data correctly

=== Testing Capacity Management ===
✓ PASS: Reserve doesn't shrink capacity
✓ PASS: Reserve increases capacity
✓ PASS: Reserve doesn't affect size
✓ PASS: No reallocation after sufficient reserve

=== Testing LLM-Specific Use Cases ===
✓ PASS: Token sequence has correct length
✓ PASS: First token is correct
✓ PASS: Embedding vector has correct size
✓ PASS: Embedding values are correct
✓ PASS: Batch contains correct number of sequences
✓ PASS: Variable length sequences work

=== Testing Memory Management ===
✓ PASS: Multiple allocation/deallocation cycles complete
✓ PASS: Zero capacity vector can still grow
✓ PASS: Zero capacity vector stores elements correctly
✓ PASS: Clear makes vector empty
✓ PASS: Vector reports empty after clear
✓ PASS: Clear preserves capacity
